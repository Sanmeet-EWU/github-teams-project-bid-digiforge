#### Problem statement: Someone is struggling with their weight whether overweight or underweight and wants to get more healthy.

We would develop a platform that allows you to input your fitness goals along with your caloric intake and activity during the day then we would be able to calculate what you should be doing as far as eating and exercising in order to reach your fitness and macro goals.  We would also be able to create a plan/schedule for you to follow to reach your goals and show you how you are doing compared to how you should be as far as reaching your goal.  We could also integrate a database that has all of the nutrition facts for common foods so that the user can just input the food they ate and how much then we can take care of inputting the macros they achieved through eating that.  Then the same kind of concept for exercise where the user can input the type of exercise they did and how long then we can calculate the amount of calories they burned through doing that.

#### Problem Statement: Client requesting a website for their architecture firm that needs to showcase their work/provide details about the company. 

Our client, an architecture firm, seeks a website to showcase their portfolio and provide comprehensive information about their company. Utilizing PHP, Sass, and JavaScript, we will develop this website, with WordPress as the chosen platform. The website will be hosted on a domain rather than a personal server. Note that logo design is excluded from this task as the client already possesses one. Prior to development, collaborative design sessions with the client will be conducted to ensure alignment with their vision and requirements.

Addressing the common challenges of forgetting to care for plants or lacking knowledge about plant care, this project aims to develop a mobile or web application serving as a central platform for plant care and scheduling. Users will have access to comprehensive care information for various house plants and can create customized profiles based on predefined templates. The application will enable users to set up watering and repotting schedules for each plant profile, with integration capabilities with calendar apps for seamless management.
