## <a name="_toc1279350872"></a>Motivation:
### 1\. Problem Statement:
Fusion Architecture's website is outdated, lacking modern design elements and functionalities. This outdated site fails to effectively showcase the firm's work and services and does not provide a smooth user experience. This may lead to potential clients forming a negative impression of the firm or being unable to easily find the information they need to consider working with the firm.
## 2\. Intended User:
Fusion Architecture and their clients would be the primary users of the redesigned website. This local architecture firm aims to establish a strong online presence to attract new clients with a website that can show them the possibilities for their businesses design with Fusin Architecture and allows them easy access to finding contact information to reach out and bring their business to Fusion.  While at the same time we want to have all the information that a current client may need to help them get all their questions or concerns sorted out smoothly and easily.
### 3\. User's Problem:
The firm's current website is not user-friendly, has an outdated design, and lacks essential features such as a scheduling system, a newsletter subscription, and mobile responsiveness. These shortcomings hinder the firm from reaching a wider audience, showcasing their work effectively, and engaging with potential clients efficiently. The site may also result in lower search engine rankings due to outdated design practices and lack of optimization.
### 4\. Solution Benefits:
A redesigned website will benefit Fusion Architecture in several ways:



- Enhanced User Experience: A modern design and intuitive navigation will make it easier for visitors to find relevant information, leading to a more positive impression of the firm.
- Increased Client Engagement: Integrating features such as appointment scheduling, contact forms, and chatbots will facilitate better communication with potential clients and make it easier for them to engage with the firm.
- Improved Online Presence: A visually appealing and mobile-responsive website, along with SEO optimization, will increase the firm's visibility on search engines and attract more organic traffic.
- Showcasing Portfolio: A dedicated portfolio section with high-quality images and detailed descriptions will showcase the firm's work effectively, helping to establish credibility and expertise.
- Cost and Time Savings: An efficient appointment scheduling system and other self-service options reduce the administrative burden on staff, freeing up time for other important tasks.
- Brand Reputation: A professional and updated website enhances the firm's brand reputation, positioning them as a modern and forward-thinking architecture firm.




## <a name="_toc1503637783"></a>Approach:

General Flow:  

We’ll Start by creating a template that functions with Docker and WordPress while working with our client to develop a design that they like, then we’ll move onto developing the site, Next, we’ll test it to make sure it works on all search engines, and finally we’ll deploy it, this is a very basic description of what's to come.

**Nature of Solution:** Website redevelopment.

**Software Components:** WordPress, GitHub, SEO Rush, multiple plugins

**Frontend:** PHP/SCSS, JavaScript (NextJS or Astro for framework), ACF Pro for field building.

**Backend:** PHP for server-side scripting.

<a name="_int_n2busoct"></a>**Version Control:** GitHub.

**Content Management System:** WordPress.

**SEO tracking:** SEO Rush.

**Hardware Components**: No specific hardware components are required beyond standard devices for development and testing such as laptops or computers.


## <a name="_toc1203167128"></a>Challenges and Risks:
Our first challenge is to develop a working template in a reasonable time, this template will be our bread and butter for when we start working on the website. Then Our next biggest challenge will be working with our client to decide on what kind of design they want and how the website should look when we’re ready to develop it, this is one of the most important steps since redesigning the site takes a lot of time and effort. Since this project is also a product, we must ensure that it is developed on schedule and that we seamlessly integrate new features and functionalities while maintaining compatibility with existing systems and content, We must employ the best coding practices to guarantee the success of this project. 

The biggest risk we have is developing and deploying a site that is not in working order, If it is not correctly tested and something goes wrong, it not only reflects poorly upon us but also the business we worked for, things like a page not working or CSS not being tested on all platforms (like safari and Firefox)  can completely ruin a site.   To avoid these mistakes, we will make sure to create a solid structure and plan for what needs to be expected from the site before we go into development.  We will also make sure to have frequent and clear communication with the clients in order to ensure we are meeting the expectations that they have for their website, and they are happy with the project before it’s theoretically too late to go back.
